Generic VNF configuration management and orchestration

## Speaker Bio

Adam Israel is a software engineer with over twenty years of experience, much of which has been spent designing and building web applications to run at scale. He current works at Canonical, where his work with Juju intersects with benchmarking, telecommunications, and the developer experience.

## Abstract

The telecommunication industry is in a state of disruption as network functions (DNS, firewall, routers, etc) are virtualized. The days of running these workloads on proprietary hardware are ending.

In this session, I will show you how these VNFs are created, how to manage the complex configurations between them, and how to operate them at scale.
