## Abstract

The telecommunication industry is in a state of disruption as network functions (DNS, firewall, routers, etc) are virtualized. The days of running these workloads on proprietary hardware are ending. These virtualized network functions (VNFs) can run on bare metal, commodity hardware, and in the public cloud.
